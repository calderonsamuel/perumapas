<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `perumapas` is to have an easy way to draw maps with peruvian shapes.

## Installation

You can install the released version of perumapas from the [calderonsamuel r-universe](https://calderonsamuel.r-universe.dev/) with:

``` r
install.packages("perumapas", repos = 'https://calderonsamuel.r-universe.dev')
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# messages were removed
library(perumapas) # usar siempre junto con sf
library(sf) # obligatorio!
library(ggplot2) # for plotting
library(dplyr) # for filtering
```

You can create maps easily.


```{r example}
mapa_distrital %>% 
  filter(departamento == "LIMA", provincia == "LIMA") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf()
```

`mapa_distrital` has avaiable the *ubigeo* field to easily join/merge with another dataset.

```{r}
head(mapa_distrital, 10)
```

To learn how to use `mapa_regional` and `mapa_provincial` see `vignette('basic-usage')`.

## Shapefiles source

The shapefiles for `mapa_distrital` were obtained from <https://www.geogpsperu.com/2019/05/limite-distrital-actualizado-inei.html>
